# Contributor Overview

Don't know what the applicable repository for an issue is? Open up in issue in [workflow][] or chat with a maintainer in the [Deis #community Slack channel][slack] and we'll make sure it gets to the right place.

Additionally, take a look at the [troubleshooting][] documentation for common issues.

Before opening a new issue, it's helpful to search and see if anyone else has already reported the problem. You can search through a list of issues for all Deis projects [here][issues].

## Write Documentation

We are always looking to improve and expand our documentation. Most docs reside in the [deis/workflow][workflow] repository. Simply fork the project, update docs and send us a pull request.

## Contribute Code

We are always looking for help improving the core platform, other workloads, tooling, and test coverage. Interested in contributing code? Let’s chat in the [Deis #community Slack channel][slack]. Make sure to check out issues tagged [easy-fix][].

When you're ready to begin writing code, review [Design Documents][dd] and get your [Development Environment][dev-environment] set up.

By contributing to any Deis project you agree to its [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)][dco]. This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

## Triage Issues

If you don't have time to code, consider helping with triage. The community will thank you for saving them time by spending some of yours. See [Triaging Issues](triaging-issues.md) for more info.

## Share your Experience

Interact with the community on our user mailing list or live in our [Deis #community Slack channel](https://slack.deis.io), where you can chat with other Deis Workflow users any time of day.

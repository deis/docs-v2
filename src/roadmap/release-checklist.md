# Release Checklist

This document describes how to release a new Workflow version. It's targeted toward the Deis core
maintainers.

The below sections present a step-by-step guide to publish a new Workflow release. Throughout all
of the examples, we'll be assuming that the below four environment variables are present wherever
you're working. Make sure to set them (e.g. by `export`ing them) before you get started.

- `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` - the full name of this version. For example, `v2.0.0-rc2` for a pre-release version or `v2.0.0` otherwise.
- `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT` - The short name of this version. For example, `rc2` for a pre-release version or identical to `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` above otherwise.
- `$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE` - the full name of the previous version. For example, `v2.0.0-rc1` for a pre-release version or `v2.0.0` otherwise.
- `$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE_SHORT` - The short name of the previous version. For example, `rc1` for a pre-release version or identical to `$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE` above otherwise.

# What's a Release?

A release consists of the following artifacts:

1. Docker images with `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` tags for each Deis Workflow component:
  - [builder](https://github.com/deis/builder)
  - [controller](https://github.com/deis/controller)
  - [dockerbuilder](https://github.com/deis/dockerbuilder)
  - [fluentd](https://github.com/deis/fluentd)
  - [logger](https://github.com/deis/logger)
  - [minio](https://github.com/deis/minio)
  - [monitor](https://github.com/deis/monitor)
  - [postgres](https://github.com/deis/postgres)
  - [redis](https://github.com/deis/redis)
  - [registry](https://github.com/deis/registry)
  - [router](https://github.com/deis/router)
  - [slugbuilder](https://github.com/deis/slugbuilder)
  - [slugrunner](https://github.com/deis/slugrunner)
  - [workflow](https://github.com/deis/workflow)
  - [workflow-e2e](https://github.com/deis/workflow-e2e)
  - [workflow-manager](https://github.com/deis/workflow-manager)
  - [workflow-cli](https://github.com/deis/workflow-cli)
2. A new [Helm Classic chart for Workflow](https://github.com/deis/charts) that references all of the new
images referenced above. For example, if `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` is `2.0.0-v2.0.0`, the new chart would
be in a new directory called `workflow-v2.0.0`.

# Step 1: Bump Client and Server Versions

Before cutting the repo branches, the client and server versions need to be updated to the new
version.

  1. Make a PR to bump [the client version][client-platform-version]
  2. Make a PR to bump [the server version][server-platform-version]

If necessary, you will also need to bump the API version. This version number is only bumped if any
API-related changes have been made this release. To do this:

  1. Make a PR to bump [the SDK API version](https://github.com/deis/controller-sdk-go/blob/master/deis.go#L92)
  2. Make a PR to bump [the client version of the SDK](https://github.com/deis/workflow-cli/blob/master/glide.yaml#L18) and run `glide up`
  3. Make a PR to bump [the server API version](https://github.com/deis/controller/blob/master/rootfs/api/__init__.py#L5)
  4. Make a PR to add [documentation for the new API version](https://github.com/deis/workflow/pull/357)

!!! important

    make sure to get all these PRs merged before proceeding to the next step.

# Step 2: Cut repo branches and push image tags

  Once the release milestone is cleared of tickets in the workflow component repos, the release branches can be cut.

  If only a particular repo is ready, navigate to said repo and:

        git checkout master && git pull upstream master
        git checkout -b release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE && git push upstream release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE

  Otherwise, for bulk-cutting all repos at the same time, run the following command:

  ```console
  deisrel branches create --name="release-${WORKFLOW_RELEASE} --ref="master" --yes=true
  ```

# Step 3: Update Jenkins Jobs

We'll need to update the `WORKFLOW_RELEASE` value used by all relevant Jenkins jobs, particularly so the [workflow-test-release](https://ci.deis.io/job/workflow-test-release/) job can kick off automatically once the `release-${WORKFLOW_RELEASE}` branch is pushed to in `Step 3` below.  Update this value in the [common.groovy](https://github.com/deis/jenkins-jobs/blob/master/common.groovy) file and push this change to master:

      git clone git@github.com:deis/jenkins-jobs.git
      # update WORKFLOW_RELEASE value
      git commit -a -m "chore(workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT): update WORKFLOW_RELEASE"
      git push upstream HEAD:master

!!! note

    As of this writing, the e2e tests run on a GKE cluster using default internal (minio) storage. The e2e tests can run using supported external storage permutations via the [storage_backend_e2e](https://ci.deis.io/job/storage_backend_e2e/) job, providing `STORAGE_TYPE` of 'gcs' and 'aws', along with the `HELM_REMOTE_BRANCH` updated to `release-${WORKFLOW_RELEASE}` after the release chart is created in `Step 3` below.

# Step 4: Create New Helm Classic Charts

Next, we'll create new [Helm Classic](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic) charts so that we can "stage" a
version of our release for testing. Here is the current process to do so:

  1. Checkout the `release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` branch in [deis/charts](https://github.com/deis/charts) (created in Step 2.2 above):

        git fetch upstream
        git checkout release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE

  2. Download the [deisrel](https://github.com/deis/deisrel) binary via the links provided in the project's README. Once downloaded, place the binary in your `$PATH`.

  3. Copy the current `dev` charts into new `workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT` charts:

        cp -r workflow-dev workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT
        cp -r workflow-dev-e2e workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT-e2e
        cp -r router-dev router-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT

  4. Run `deisrel git shas --ref=master` to get the current SHAs at the tip of the `master` branch on each repo

  5. Change the `generate_params.toml` files in each new chart as follows:
    1. Set all `pullPolicy` values to `IfNotPresent`
    2. Set all `dockerTag` values to `git-${REPO_SHA}`, where `${REPO_SHA}` is the appropriate sha for the repository, as reported in step (3)

  6. Delete the `KUBERNETES_POD_TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` env var from `workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT/tpl/deis-controller-rc.yaml`

  7. Test the new Workflow chart and make sure it installs:

        cp -r workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT* `helmc home`/workspace/charts
        helmc generate workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT
        helmc install workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT

    Optionally, run the e2e tests as well:

        helmc generate workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT-e2e
        helmc install workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT-e2e

  8. Commit your changes:

        git commit -a -m "chore(workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT): releasing workflow-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_SHORT(-e2e)"

  9. Push your changes:

        git push upstream HEAD:release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE


  10. Open a pull request from your branch to merge into `master` on https://github.com/deis/charts

# Step 5: Update Documentation

Create a new pull request against deis/workflow, updating all references of the old release to
`$WORKFLOW_RELEASE`. Use `git grep $WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE` and `git grep
$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE_SHORT` to find any references. (Be careful not to change `CHANGELOG.md`)

Also, note there may be occurrences of an older release (prior to
`$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE`) in `upgrading-workflow.md`. These should be changed to
`$WORKFLOW_PREV_RELEASE`.

# Step 6: Manual Testing

After the chart is created with the immutable Docker image tags that represent the final images
(i.e. the ones that will be re-tagged to the immutable release tag, such as `v2.0.0`), it
should be manually tested by as many people as possible. Special attention should be paid to the
user experience, both from an operator and developer perspective.

Our goal is to test with as many object storage and Kubernetes installation configurations as
possible, to ensure there are no gaps in configuration or functionality. See below for a sample testing
matrix.

Object Storage / Kubernetes Install | Kube-Solo | Google Container Engine | AWS | Micro-Kube | Vagrant |
----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | --- | ---------- | ------- |
Default (Minio)                     |
Google Cloud Storage                |
Amazon S3                           |


!!! note

    If bugs are found and fixes are made, do the following:

    - PR the fix, get it reviewed and merged into master of component repo(s)
    - git cherry-pick <issue_fix_sha> into the `release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` branch(es) of component repo(s)
    - the component's `<component>-release` [Jenkins job](https://ci.deis.io) watches for the push to the release branch and will trigger building and deploying  the `git-<issue_fix_sha>` Docker image.
    - update the appropriate component's `dockerTag` value in the release chart with the `git-<issue_fix_sha>` as deployed above.
    - push updated chart change(s) to existing release branch and re-convene testing

The pull request should **not** be merged yet--it will be updated with SemVer-tagged docker images in the next step.

!!! note

    If non-release-specific amendments have been made to the release chart that do
    not exist in the `workflow-dev`, be sure to PR said changes for this chart as well.

# Step 7: Tag and Push Docker Images

It's time to retag each individual Docker image with the 'official' `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` value in the `deis` [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/deis) org.

To do so, simply run the following `deisrel` command:

```console
deisrel docker retag $WORKFLOW_RELEASE --new-org="deis -ref release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE"
```

Update the PR by replacing all `dockerTag` values with the `$WORKFLOW_RELEASE` tag. Make sure the pull request is reviewed once more and merged before continuing.

# Step 8: Update Changelogs

At this point, part of the first part and all of the second part of the release is complete.
That is, the Helm Classic chart for the new Workflow version is done, and new Docker versions for all
components are done.

The remaining work is simply generating changelogs and tagging each component's GitHub repository.

To generate changelogs, run the below command in each repository. Ensure that `$PREVIOUS_TAG` is
the previous tag that was generated in the repository.

```console
deisrel changelog individual $REPO_NAME $PREVIOUS_TAG $CURRENT_SHA $WORKFLOW_RELEASE
```

This command will output the new changelog entry to STDOUT. Copy it and paste into the GitHub release notes section for the release tag.

Repeat these steps to create the changelog content for every Workflow component's release notes.

# Step 9: Tag and Push Git Repositories

The final step of the release process is to tag each git repository, and push the tag to each
GitHub project. To do so, simply run the below command in the `deisrel` repository:

```console
deisrel git tag --ref release-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE $WORKFLOW_RELEASE
```

# Step 10: Close GitHub Milestones

Close the github milestone by creating a new pull request at
[seed-repo](https://github.com/deis/seed-repo). Any changes merged to master on that repository
will be applied to all of the component projects. If there are open issues attached to the
milestone, move them to the next upcoming milestone before merging the pull request.

# Step 11: Let Everyone Know

Jump in #company on slack and let folks know that the release has been cut! This will let
folks in supporting functions know that they should start the release support process including
summary blog posts, tweets, notes for the monthly newsletter updates, etc.

Provide a gist to the aggregated release notes.  We can generate the aggregated changelog data from `deisrel`:

```console
deisrel changelog global $PREVIOUS_TAG $WORKFLOW_RELEASE
```

You are now done with the release.

# Step 12: Bump Client and Server Versions to the Next Development Version

After finishing the release, you'll now need to advance the client and server versions to the next
targeted release. For example, if `v2.2.0` was just cut and the next release on the roadmap is
`v2.3.0`, make a PR to bump the [client][client-platform-version] and
[server][server-platform-version] versions to `v2.3.0-dev`.
